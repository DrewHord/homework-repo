I was at the post office for 6 years before leaving to pursue a carreer in software development. I need a job that will allow me to support my daughter 
but not take up all of my time. I'm nervous about leaving my job, but I know this will be better in the end. It's going to be a tough course
but I am ready to dedicate myself to it.
